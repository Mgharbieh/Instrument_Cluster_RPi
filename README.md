## Key Features

* Load Driver Profiles - Quick, easy way to minimize downtime

  - Easily readable interface for important vehicle information updated in real time
* Warning messages for ECU faults/issues
* In-vehicle video games

## How To Use
The Driver interface is designed to work with buttons wired to the Raspberry Pi, however, we have also included a set of keypresses that work to emulate the controls.

### Main Controls:
* Arrow Keys
  - Left: open options menu or select the highlighted item in options menu
  - Up:   Scroll upward
  - Down: Scroll downward
  - Right: Open game menu or select the hilighted item in game menu
* Extra Keys
  - W: Simulate ECU fault warning
  - P: Power off (only on PiOS, will not work on other operating systems
  - Escape or Q: Close application

## Download
The program was originally designed to be used on a Raspberry Pi, however, a demo mode with limited functionality will be available to run on Windows.  MacOS devices are currently not supported.

### WINDOWS DEMO MODE
When available, navigate to the packages folder and download ***INSTRUMENT_CLUSTER_WIN_DEMO*** as a zipped file.  Simply unzip the file and launch the .exe file to run the demo.
The demo will support most UI functions, including animations, easter eggs, and games.  Controls can be found in the readme file included in the zip file.


### LINUX
